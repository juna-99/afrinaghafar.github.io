## Projects
### Student Performance Prediction
[GitHub](https://github.com/juna-99/Student-Performance-Prediction)

Developed a machine learning model for predicting student performance, leveraging various factors to provide early intervention strategies using Python. Implemented a Flask web application to deliver insights through a user-friendly interface, and deployed it on AWS Cloud for scalability and reliability. This project led to more accurate identification of at-risk students, demonstrating the potential of data-driven approaches in educational outcomes. The automated process enhances decision-making by offering precise predictions and actionable insights.

### Chicken Disease Classification
[GitHub](https://github.com/juna-99/Chicken-Disease-Classification-Project)

Developed a deep learning model for Chicken Disease Classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The project involved creating an end-to-end pipeline that ingested data from GitHub, trained a VGG16 model on images of chicken feces, and deployed the model on AWS using GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between healthy and infected samples, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in medical diagnostics. This work highlights the potential of leveraging image classification to enhance poultry health management and streamline disease detection processes.
