### Chicken Disease Classification
[GitHub](https://github.com/juna-99/Chicken-Disease-Classification-Project)

Developed a deep learning model for Chicken Disease Classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The project involved creating an end-to-end pipeline that ingested data from GitHub, trained a VGG16 model on images of chicken feces, and deployed the model on AWS using GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between healthy and infected samples, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in medical diagnostics. This work highlights the potential of leveraging image classification to enhance poultry health management and streamline disease detection processes.

### Cooking Oil Price Prediction in Malaysia
[GitHub](https://github.com/juna-99/Cooking-Oil-Price-Prediction)
Project Overview: Developed and validated time series forecasting models to predict grocery prices using a variety of techniques such as SARIMA and LSTM neural networks. The project focused on identifying key trends and seasonal patterns in daily price fluctuations, providing accurate short-term and long-term price forecasts.

Achievements:

 • Achieved a 15% improvement in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by optimizing SARIMA and LSTM model parameters.

 • Built a multi-step data pipeline to handle over 100,000 records, automating data cleaning and feature engineering, resulting in a 30% reduction in preprocessing time.

 • Implemented a scalable LSTM model with Keras, utilizing early stopping and hyperparameter tuning, leading to a 25% reduction in training time and 8% higher forecast accuracy.
